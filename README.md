A complete rewrite of pterodactyl wings.

## Roadmap

This project is still a work in progress. Here are some of the key features and improvements we're planning to implement:

- [ ] Understand and implement how the wings server authenticates with the panel.
- [ ] Implement all the API endpoints.
- [ ] Implement the wings SFTP server. (This is a big one)
- [ ] Implement the websocket server with reoccurring tasks like sending stats to the panel. (This is another big one)
- [ ] Docker management (start, stop, restart, etc) with windows support.
- [ ] Figure out how to handle the `wings` configuration file.
- [ ] Handle pterodactyl eggs. _(oh no what have I gotten myself into)_
- And probably a lot more.

Due to the nature of this project, the roadmap is subject to change at any time. If you think something should be added to the roadmap, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
